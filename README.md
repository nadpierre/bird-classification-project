# Bird Image Classification Project

## Description

The goal of this project is to build an image classification model with the best possible performance.

## Dataset

The data comes from the [Bird Species dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/umairshahpirzada/birds-20-species-image-classification/data).

## Model

The model used is a pretrained [Vision Transformer (ViT) from Google](https://huggingface.co/google/vit-base-patch16-224). It has been fine-tuned with the dataset. After training, the model reached an 100% accuracy.
